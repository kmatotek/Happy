# Custom Programming Language

## Introduction
This programming language supports variable assignments, conditional expressions, loops, function definitions, list operations, and string formatting. It aims to provide a clean and concise syntax for common programming constructs while supporting features such as function calls, list manipulation, and control flow.

## Syntax Overview

### Variable Assignment
Variables are assigned using the `VAR` keyword followed by an identifier, the equals sign `=`, and an expression.

```plaintext
VAR variable_name = expr

VAR x = 10
VAR isEqual = (5 == 5)
